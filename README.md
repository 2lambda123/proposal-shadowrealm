### Updating the spec text for this proposal

The source for the spec text is located in [spec/index.emu](spec/index.emu) and it is written in
[ecmarkup](https://github.com/bterlson/ecmarkup) language.

When modifying the spec text, you should be able to build the HTML version in
`index.html` by using the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
open index.html
```

Alternative, you can use `npm run watch`.
